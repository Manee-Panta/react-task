            I Design & Build Websites. I'm a creative web
            designer and programmer with good knowledge of frontend techniques.
            I like structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love
            spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. I
            love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to make
            eye-catching, assessible and user-friendly websites and
            applications. I'm exited to make the leap and continue refining my
            skills with the right company.
